Ingredients:

- Double-Crust Pastry
- 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)
- 2 tablespoons butter or margarine

Directions:

1 Heat oven to 425ºF. Prepare Double-Crust Pastry.

2 Mix sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in large bowl. 
  Stir in apples. Turn into pastry-lined pie plate. Dot with butter. 
  Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.
  
3 Roll other round of pastry. Fold into fourths and cut slits so 
  steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. 
  Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. 
  Cover edge with 3-inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning. Remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking.
